# Some things to know
- `;` is used to conjoin lines, `<;>` is used to perform repeat applications.
- `at *` applies whatever you're doing to every hypothesis and the goal.

## The full meaning of `->`
In this document, I sometimes describe expressions of the form `A -> B`. This can represent an implication or a forall. Also, negation `¬A` is represented as `A -> False`.

## Questions
- Is there a key I can press to convert the current phrase into the symbol? Like `\and` -> `∧`
- How does `convert` work? (I know they explained it but it's just a bit shaky right now.) And wth is `using 1` at the end of `convert`?
- How to use `cases` and declare the variable name too?
- What exactly does `<;>` do?
- In lean, is it easy to separate what requires classical logic versus what doesn't?
- Is there a notebook filetype for lean like .rmd or .ipynd?
- How do I create a testing context? I want to be able to write things like
  ```lean
  let my_type := Fin 1
  let x : my_type := 0
  let y : my_type := 1 -- fails
  ```

## Wishes
- I wish there was a way to autocomplete the structure of a proof with `sorry`s

# All the lean tactics

## `rfl`
`rfl` my beloved. I forgor exactly what `rfl` does though.

## `assumption`
`assumption` will find an existing term (like a hypothesis) you already have and will solve the goal using it. If no such term exists, the tactic will fail.

## `constructor`
At least in the case of `∧`, `constructor` will split the goal `A ∧ B` into two goals, `A` and `B`.

## `rcases`
Kinda the opposite of `constructor`. For example, given a term `A ∧ B`, it will break it down into two terms `A` and `B`. Use like `rcases h with ⟨h₀, h₁⟩`.

## `apply`
This will take a term of the form `A1 -> ... -> An -> B` and will solve a goal that matches `B`, replacing it with the goals `A1` through `An`. Sometimes `B` depends on some variables in `A1` through `An`, which may require some manual adjustment to get Lean to understand what you want. (I wish there was a more ergonomic way to do this in general.)

This tactic may be slightly more powerful than described, but the same spirit of the tactic applies.

## `intro`
If you have a goal of the form `A -> B`, you can write `intro A` to bring `A` into the context and change the goal to just `B`.

## `rintro`
A more powerful form of `intro` that can also destruct constructors like `rcases`.

## `rw`
Syntax is `rw [f]` or `rw [f1 f2 f3]` or `rw [f1 f2 f3] at h`. Given a term of the form `f := x = y`, `rw [f]` will replace all instances of `x` with `y` in the goal (or term `h` if using `at h`). Sometimes `f` is parameterized, in which case `rw` will just set the parameterization based on the first instance it can find, and then make as many rewrites using that parameterization as possible.

For non-functions, will just substitute the term for the definition.

### `nth_rw`
This is a special version of `rw`, called using `nth_rw n [f]`, that will only perform a rewrite on the `n`th matching instance.

### `rwa`
Also calls `assumption` after the rewrite completes.

## `simp`
According to the documentation, `simp` simplifies the main goal target using lemmas tagged with the attribute
- Use `at h` to simplify within a hypothesis.
- Write `simp only [f]` to only simplify according to `f`.
- Write `simp [-f]` to prevent `f` from being used to simplify the expression.


## `exact`
`exact`ly what you think it does
can function like return.

## `contrapose`
Use `contrapose! ¬A` to swap the term `¬A` and goal `¬B` with the term `B` and the goal `A`. This causes the term `¬A` to be removed from the context.

## `ext`
Takes a goal of the form `fun x => f x = fun x => g x`, intros `x`, and replaces the goal with `f x = g x`. Works with multiple arguments as well.

## `congr`
Given goal `f x = f y`, replaces the goal with `x = y`.

## `convert`
`convert` is kind of magic. It seems like it let's you assume that you've proved certain relations, finishes the proof using everything you've supplied, and then politely returns the relations it inferred it needed.

## `trivial`
A proof of `True`.

## `use`
Fill in a value for an existential quantifier or an `and` or any other construction.
It seems that when you call this lean will also fill in any other values from the terms that it can. Why doesn't it do that automatically with other terms like `rw`? Is there a version that doesn't do that?
